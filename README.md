# Distributed Database for the Health Care Industry

This project, developed as part of the CSCI 5408 Data Management course, focuses on implementing a distributed database system tailored for the health care industry. Leveraging Java programming language and Google Cloud Platform's Cloud SQL service, the project addresses various aspects such as database design, fragmentation logic, and the implementation of a Global Data Catalog (GDC).

## Overview

In industries like health care, implementing distributed database systems is crucial for managing vast amounts of data efficiently. This project offers a hands-on experience in designing, implementing, and managing a distributed database system specifically tailored for the needs of the health care industry.

## Key Features

- **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):** The project begins with designing an ERD to model the relationships between different entities in the health care domain. This provides a blueprint for the database schema.

- **Fragmentation Logic:** Fragmentation of the database involves partitioning the data across different database instances located in various geographical locations. Designing an effective fragmentation logic ensures that data is stored and accessed optimally based on the location and relevance.

- **Global Data Catalog (GDC):** The GDC serves as a centralized repository for metadata about the distributed database. It provides a comprehensive view of the database schema, data distribution, and other relevant information.

- **Java Code Implementation:** Java programming language is used to develop code for parsing and fetching data from the distributed database instances. This code facilitates seamless interaction with the database and retrieval of required information.

## Challenges

- **Fragmentation Strategy:** Designing an efficient fragmentation strategy tailored to the specific needs of the health care industry poses a significant challenge. It requires careful consideration of factors such as data volume, access patterns, and regulatory requirements.

- **Global Data Catalog Fields:** Identifying and defining the relevant fields for the Global Data Catalog involves understanding the information needs of stakeholders and ensuring that the catalog provides comprehensive metadata about the distributed database.

## Conclusion

The Distributed Database for the Health Care Industry project offers valuable insights and practical experience in implementing distributed database systems. It underscores the importance of effective database design, fragmentation logic, and metadata management in catering to the unique requirements of the health care domain.
